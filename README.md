## Prelearn

PRELEARN (Prerequisite Relation Learning) is a shared task on concept prerequisite learning which consists of classifying prerequisite relations between pairs of concepts distinguishing between prerequisite pairs and non-prerequisite pairs. For the purposes of this task, prerequisite relation learning is proposed as a problem of binary classification between two distinct concepts (i.e. a concept pair).
